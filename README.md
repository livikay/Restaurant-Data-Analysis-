Restaurant Data Analysis 
Pre covid (2019) to Post covid (2020)
Ohio v Texas 


Why choose this data?

The Covid-19 pandemic greatly hindered life as we know it, specifically the restaurant industry and how it affects our lives. We chose the United States not only because our group resides here, but also because of the diversity state by state in how it dealt with the pandemic. We wanted to represent the differences in two vastly different states in how their decisions affected restaurant experience and expectations. 

Furthermore, why Ohio and Texas?

Ohio had an extended lockdown period as well as stronger regulations where Texas was more relaxed in its lock down procedures and opened the state earlier than most in the nation. The two states seem to vary and contrast in their regulations enough to show different outcomes. 

How did 3-5 star restaurants rate pre-pandemic vs. post-pandemic?

We found overall using the top 20 restaurants in a data set of around 3,000 for each state that fast food restaurants i.e. Wendyâ€™s, McDonalds, and Chick-Fil-A fared best and increased in average customer reviews for the state of Ohio. However, overall their average rating score fell from an average of 4.46 to 4.37. We can draw the assumption that people turned to fast food restaurants opposed to sit down dining for their restaurant needs. 

In the state of Texas, we found that the overall average customer rating rose slightly among all restaurants from 4.53 to 4.56. We also found that coffee shops seemed to be the most prevalent among the top restaurants rated and increased in average score. We can infer those customers moved from slow paced indoor dining to a faster paced experience. 

How many restaurants survived during the pandemic?

Despite varying Covid procedures the same number of restaurants managed to stay opened through 2019 to 2020 in Ohio and Texas, however Ohio seemed to be affected more by restaurant closures compared to Texas with (39) and (67) in Ohio. While Ohio and Texas contrasted on how they thought regulations should be enforced the amount of newly opened restaurants were similar with 2,297 in Texas and 2,015 in Ohio.


When did reviews plumet and how long did it take to rebound?

We saw a sharp dip in review count starting in February of 2020 and they did not seem to rise again until April of 2020. We can infer that during lockdown restaurant accessibility was limited and the priority of restaurant experiences was not present during this time. By August the review counts began to steadily rise and almost compared to 2019 for both Texas and Ohio. 

How were customer reviews effected pre pandemic v post pandemic?

The count of customer reviews rose and was more abundant during the pandemic than in pre pandemic times. From this we can infer that perhaps during pandemic times that people took to online reviewing to understand the hours of operation and the restaurants covid protocol. 

Who will this benefit from this data analysis? 

Current restaurant and future business owners can use this information to gauge how another pandemic-like or world altering event would affect businesses opening/closing, health protocols, and better plan expansion to cater to the needs of the market during strict times. 

Future scope:

Using a larger time frame and more states in the nation would make our analysis more expansive where we could gather most and least successful states and or group them by restaurant types by region. This could give us a larger/clearer picture on how the pandemic truly affected the restaurant industry in the United States.
